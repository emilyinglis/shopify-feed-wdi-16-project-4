# Shopify Feeder

### Automatically pull products from a Shopify store and render on an external website using the Shopift Feeder. 

##INTRODUCTION

Wander is a contemporary marketplace, selling products from emerging brands in the UK.

Unlike typical marketplaces, Wander is highly curated; each brand is hand-picked based on the quality and style of their products.

Trading for a year, we have found two key challenges that we believe can be rectified.

##THE PROBLEM

The most important thing to Wander is to help support emerging businesses. 

However, these businesses are typically small in size (sometimes just a single person) and lack the luxury of resource and subsequently, time.

As such, we have to date offered a concierge service whereby when a brand joins Wander, we take on the task of manually uploading and managing their products - which in turn, impacts our own resources as an emerging business.

With this in mind, we require a tool that will answer this problem and eradicate the time spent on product management.

##THE ANSWER

With the majority of our brands - and other emerging retail brands - selling their products through the Shopify platform, it makes sense to start there.

We are going to build a tool that will answer the needs of both the seller and Wander, by 'pulling' in products from the seller's Shopify store and rendering on the Wander website - using the Shopify API.

Further still, to ensure consistency for both businesses and respective customers, we need product inventory to be passed both ways - so when an item sells on Wander, we 'push' back the updated inventory to the seller's Shopify store.
